# Public Sector AI Platform (SC-Aligned) — Simulated

A simulated public-sector AI system built to demonstrate SC-aligned engineering for AI Solutions Engineer roles.

This project mirrors how regulated UK public-sector organisations would design and deploy LLM-powered systems with strong emphasis on security, auditability, and reliability.

## Key Capabilities
- Python + FastAPI API-first architecture
- Agentic LLM workflows (planned)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG (planned)
- Evaluation and guardrails to reduce hallucinations (planned)
- Auditability and traceability (planned)
- Secure-by-design principles

## Why this project exists
Public-sector and regulated environments require AI systems that are:
- Explainable and auditable
- Secure and privacy-aware
- Production-ready
- Designed with low tolerance for hallucinations

This repository is structured to reflect real-world AI Solutions Engineer delivery work.

## Current Status
- ✅ Repository and API scaffold
- 🧩 Agents, RAG, GraphRAG, and evaluations coming next

## Planned Architecture
Client  
→ FastAPI API  
→ Agent Orchestrator  
→ Retrieval (RAG / GraphRAG)  
→ Reasoning  
→ Validation  
→ Audit Log
