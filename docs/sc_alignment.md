# SC-alignment (Simulated)

This project is a simulated public-sector AI platform designed to demonstrate SC-aligned engineering practices:
- API-first architecture (FastAPI)
- Auditability and traceability (planned audit log module)
- Guardrails and response validation (planned)
- Model-agnostic approach to support hosted or local LLM deployment
- Data minimisation and secure-by-design considerations
